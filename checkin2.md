# CS1470 Final Project: check in #2

### Introduction: 
- We will implement an existing paper that created a “universal” detector to identify fake images generated by 11 different CNN-based models. We chose this paper because XX. This is a classification problem that categorizes image datasets into real and CNN-generated images.

### Challenges: What has been the hardest part of the project you’ve encountered so far?
- We have so far encountered quite a few errors as we attempt to convert PyTorch-based scripts to TensorFlow Keras. We were able to create a model without using the weights from the original paper and test it with an image, but we still struggle to solve an error after converting PyTorch model to Keras (error=tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.UnimplementedError: The Conv2D op currently only supports the NHWC tensor format on the CPU. The op was given the format: NCHW [Op:Conv2D]''')
 
### Insights: Are there any concrete results you can show at this point? 
- We have a result using ResNet50 weights that are pre-trained but not trained in our framework. Currently, this produces two probabilities (one for real, another for fake, but we have not assigned the labels). However, we are still working on fixing errors for our trained model, and we have no concrete results yet. Therefore, we are not sure yet whether the model will perform as we expect. 

### Plan: Are you on track with your project?

What do you need to dedicate more time to?
- We need to put more thought in how to train the models efficiently, either by using a smaller portion of the dataset or using google cloud for better compute power. We also would like to dedicate more time in considering unique ways in testing the network once we have finished training it.  

What are you thinking of changing, if anything?
- We are changing our base goal to include training the network to predict the data rather than just importing the weights (there seems to be problems with weight importing)
