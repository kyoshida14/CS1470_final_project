### demo.py (work in progress)
A function to use ResNet50, with or without using weights saved from the original study. 

The datasets of weights from the original paper (Wang et al., 2020) are too big to upload, but they can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/PeterWang512/CNNDetection/tree/master/weights).
